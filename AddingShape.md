This page describes how to add new shape, defined by a relatively small number of parameters. These shapes provide a high-level description, which is automatically discretized by `ADDA` into a set of dipoles (voxels). If you just want `ADDA` to read voxel structure from file, please consider [adding support for new format of shape file](AddingShapeFileFormat.md) instead.

All places in the code, where something should be added, are commented. These comments start with "`TO ADD NEW SHAPE`" and contain detailed description; the text below is less detailed. Added code should be analogous to shapes already present. The procedure is the following:
  * Add new shape descriptor in the file [const.h](http://code.google.com/p/a-dda/source/browse/trunk/src/const.h). Starting descriptor name with `SH_` is recommended, as well as adding a descriptive comment.
  * Add information about the new shape in the file [param.c](http://code.google.com/p/a-dda/source/browse/trunk/src/param.c). It should be a new row in the constant array `shape_opt`. This line should contain: the shape name (it will be used in a command line), usage string (the description of possible input parameters), help string (it will be shown when `-h` option is used), possible number of parameters (real values), shape descriptor. If this shape can accept variable number of parameters use `UNDEF` instead of a number and then check the number of parameters explicitly in function `PARSE_FUNC(shape)` (below in the same file). If shape accepts a single parameter with a file name, use `FNAME_ARG` instead.
  * Add initialization of the new shape as a new case in the long switch in function `InitShape` in file [make\_particle.c](http://code.google.com/p/a-dda/source/browse/trunk/src/make_particle.c) (in alphabetical order). This initialization should save all parameters from the array `sh_pars` to local variables, which should be defined in the beginning of the file (the place for that is shown by a comment). Then test all input parameters for consistency (for that you are encouraged to use functions from [param.h](http://code.google.com/p/a-dda/source/browse/trunk/src/param.h) since they would automatically produce informative output in case of error). If the shape breaks any symmetry, corresponding variables should be set to `false`. Then initialize the following variables:
    * `sh_form_str` – descriptive string that would be shown in the `log`;
    * either `yx_ratio` (_D<sub>y</sub>_/_D<sub>x</sub>_) or `n_boxY` (_n<sub>y</sub>_);
    * either `zx_ratio` (_D<sub>z</sub>_/_D<sub>x</sub>_) or `n_boxZ` (_n<sub>z</sub>_);
    * `Nmat_need` – number of different domains in this shape;
    * `volume_ratio` – ratio of particle volume (in units of dipoles) to _n<sub>x</sub>_<sup>3</sup>, it is used for dpl correction;
    * `n_boxX` - grid size for the particle, defined by shape (only when relevant);
    * `n_sizeX` – absolute size of the particle, defined by shape (only when relevant);
    * all other auxiliary variables that are used in shape generation (below).
> If you do not initialize `yx_ratio` and/or `zx_ratio` set it explicitly to `UNDEF`. If you need temporary local variables (which are used only in this part of the code), either use `tmp1` – `tmp3` or define your own (with more informative names) in the beginning of `InitShape` function.
  * Add definition of the new shape as a new case in the long switch in function `MakeParticle` in file [make\_particle.c](http://code.google.com/p/a-dda/source/browse/trunk/src/make_particle.c) (in alphabetical order). This definition should set the variable `mat` – index of domain – for each point, specified by (`xr`,`yr`,`zr`) – coordinates divided by _D<sub>x</sub>_. Do not set `mat` for void dipoles. If you need temporary local variables (which are used only in this part of the code), either use `tmp1` – `tmp3` or define your own (with more informative names) in the beginning of `MakeParticle` function.

Please refer to section _Defining a Scatterer_ of the [manual](http://a-dda.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/manual.pdf) for description of the above-mentioned variables and for general overview of how the particle shape is treated inside `ADDA`.

If you add a new predefined shape to `ADDA` according to the described procedure, please consider [contributing your code](InstructionCommitters.md) to be incorporated in future releases.
