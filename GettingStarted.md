If you are not sure, what is `ADDA` and whether it suits your needs, look first at its [Features](Features.md). If your are still unsure and have questions like "Can I use `ADDA` to ...?", look at the [Frequently asked questions](FAQ.md).

When you decide to give `ADDA` a try, obtain one of the [packages](PackageDescription.md). You may either get the source code and [compile](CompilingADDA.md) it yourself or get compiled executables for your platform (if available). All packages are available from [Downloads](Downloads.md), the source code can also be obtained directly from the [repository](http://code.google.com/p/a-dda/source/checkout).

After that you may immediately proceed to the hands-on [Tutorial](Tutorial.md) and make a few quick simulations. If you prefer a more thorough approach, please take a look at the [manual](http://a-dda.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/manual.pdf), which covers all aspects of performing light scattering simulations with `ADDA`.

If you need any help with `ADDA` or have a question, not included in the [FAQ](FAQ.md), please [write](mailto:adda-discuss@googlegroups.com) to the [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/adda-discuss). Moreover, you are encouraged to use [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/a-dda/issues/list) both to report bugs and to propose new features, improvements, etc. You can also star existing issues to influence their priorities (Google account is required for the latter).

The side bar to the left lists all available wiki pages. In addition to those mentioned above, there are [release notes](ReleaseNotes.md), [comparison with other codes](ComparisonOtherCodes.md), [collection of largest simulations](LargestSimulations.md), [useful links](Links.md), [acknowledgements](Acknowledgements.md), and [early history of ADDA](EarlyHistory.md). There are also [detailed instructions](InstructionCommitters.md), how to add new code to `ADDA` to enhance its functionality for your particular needs. We also maintain a [list of papers that use ADDA](Publications.md) and a comprehensive [list of references, relevant to different parts of ADDA](References.md).

`ADDA` is an open-source project which development relies on the community around it. There are many ways to help:
  * Using `ADDA` and advocating its use through publications and conference presentations.
  * Active participation in the [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/adda-discuss), in particular, sharing your experience with other users.
  * Commenting and improving [wiki pages](http://code.google.com/p/a-dda/w/list) and other documentation.
  * Locating bugs and proposing new features for `ADDA`, using the [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/a-dda/issues/list).
  * [Contributing](InstructionCommitters.md) and improving the source code.
